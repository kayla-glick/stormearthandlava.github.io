Greetings fellow Shamans,

TODO: It's no question that one of the most controversial - and often memed about - aspects of Elemental Shaman in retail World of Warcraft is its lack of a raid buff or unique raid utility.
With the recent addition of {{Hunter's Mark}} to the game, Elemental Shaman stands as the lone specialization that lacks a raid buff or unique group utility 
Today I want to discuss Elemental's long history as a raid buff provider

# Vanilla WoW
At its inception Shaman was a Horde-only hybrid class intended to do a mix of damage, healing, and providing buffs to a group.
Shamans provided buffs in the form of totems represented by the 4 major Elements - Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.
They could have 1 totem of each element active, and totem buffs didn't stack if multiple Shamans used the same totem.
These buffs only applied to party members however, so many groups opted to bring multiple shamans per raid in order to buff multiple parties of players.
I've included only the totems that provided what were considered useful buffs, and only at their highest-rank values.

# The Burning Crusade
The Burning Crusade doubled down on Shaman buff utility, retaining all of the original buff totems from Vanilla while adding two new powerful totem options, with [Totem of Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=30706/totem-of-wrath) given to Elemental as a new capstone ability, and [Unleashed Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=30811/unleashed-rage) given to Enhancement.
In addition, Shamans were given a new keynote ability - [Bloodlust](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=2825/bloodlust) for Horde, and [Heroism](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=32182/heroism) for Alliance.
The original iteration of Bloodlust and Heroism applied only to the Shaman's party and didn't cause the [Sated](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=57724/sated) debuff, so it could be chain cast by multiple shamans on the same group of players.
As a result, most raids stacked 4-5 Shamans whose primary responsibility was maintaining totem buffs and providing lust to the strongest DPS group.
Despite low damage numbers, Elemental was considered an essential part of any raid team to provide its new totem buffs to a group of caster DPS.

As the only Shaman option for Alliance players, Draenei Shamans also provided [Heroic Presence](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=6562/heroic-presence) to their party.
While this wasn't a Shaman-only ability, most Alliance players already had established characters and didn't want to re-roll, so Shamans frequently filled the role as the provider of this buff in their party.

# Wrath of the Lich King
Wrath of the Lich King overhauled many classes and specs, bringing new abilities, better balance, and overall more streamlined gameplay compared to its predecessors.
Most buffs were changed from party to raid-wide, along with many new buffs added to allow multiple classes and/or specs to bring the same "type" of buff that didn't stack, enabling greater group diversity.
Shaman remained the sole provider of Heroism/Bloodlust which now also applied to the entire raid at the cost of causing the [Sated](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=57724/sated) debuff.
As a result it was still considered mandatory to have at least one Shaman in any raid group.
Wrath also brought a plethora of improvements to Elemental and Shaman as a whole, improving our damage to make us more competitive and providing new buffs, including a new Elemental-only raid buff, [Elemental Oath](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=51470/elemental-oath).

# Cataclysm
With the awakening of the Earth-Warder, Deathwing, Blizzard realized that the number of raid buffs had gotten out of control, opting to drastically reduce the number of buffs but allowing most buffs to be brought in some form by two or more different specs and/or classes.
It was at this point that I personally feel Elemental peaked in terms of raid utility.
While we had many buff options in the past, the changes in Cataclysm made us the greatest buff provider with up to a whopping 7 raid buffs that could be active at once including Bloodlust and Heroism.
Totem of Wrath was changed to [Totemic Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=77746/totemic-wrath), allowing Elemental Shamans to provide another powerful Spell Power buff without sacrificing fire totem damage, while Restoration received [Ancestral Healing](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=16235/ancestral-healing) to increase their healing targets' Max HP by up to 10%.
Heroism/Bloodlust-type effects were also given to both Mages ([Time Warp](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=80353/time-warp)) and Hunters ([Primal Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=90355/primal-rage)) for the first time, removing one of Shaman's niche roles in a raid group for the first time.

# Mists of Pandaria
Mists of Pandaria is the expansion many Shaman players consider to be the start of the decline of Shaman's raid utility (and Elemental and Restoration's in particular).
Mists brought with it a massive pruning of Shaman totems and therefore raid buffs in particular.
Totems like [Strength of Earth Totem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Strength_of_Earth_Totem), [Windfury Totem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Windfury_Totem), and [Wrath of Air Totem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Wrath_of_Air_Totem) were removed entirely, while other like [Healing Stream Totem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Healing_Stream_Totem) were nerfed to only heal one party/raid member at a time and on a shorter duration with a cooldown.
Despite this however, things weren't all.
Shamans still retained several raid buffs at this point while also gaining a powerful new raid healing cooldown, [Ancestral Guidance](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancestral_Guidance).
In its origina incarnation, Ancestral Guidance healed all nearby allies for 40% of all direct damage/healing dealt split between them (later changed to 40% of damage and 60% of healing during MoP), similar to [Vampiric Embrace](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Vampiric_Embrace) and a far cry from what we have today.

# Warlords of Draenor
The orcish invasion from Draenor brought with it significant ability pruning throughout WoW.
I remember this being quite controversial at the time, with many feeling classes were losing key parts of their class identity as iconic abilities that had been around for years were removed left and right.
Along the same vein, Blizzard continued to drastically simplify raid buffs and debuffs.
[Elemental Oath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Elemental_Oath) and [Unleashed Rage](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Unleashed_Rage) were removed and the effects combined with [Grace of Air](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Grace_of_Air).
[Burning Wrath](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Burning_Wrath) was similarly removed without a replacement, and the +bonus HP effect of Ancestral Vigor (renamed [Purification]([Purification](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Restorative_Waves))) was removed as well.

> All specializations provide some common buffs and debuffs.
> These are important to the game because they encourage cooperation, make you stronger when you work together with others, and promote Raid composition diversity.
> However, we saw room to revise these buffs and debuffs.
> We also spread around some of the harder-to-find Raid buffs/debuffs, especially for specializations that brought relatively few.

# Legion and Beyond
The invasion of The Burning Legion brought about the great raid buff purge.
I remember this decision being relatively popular at the time, as both players and Blizzard alike took a strong stance for "Bring the player, not the class/spec".
Classic raid buffs like Druid's [Mark of the Wild](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_the_Wild), Priest's [Power Word: Fortitude](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Word:_Fortitude), Warrior's [Commanding Shout](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Commanding_Shout), etc. were either removed or reworked into cooldowns or effects that applied to only a few players at a time.
Blizzard quickly backtracked on the anti-raid buff sentiment in Battle for Azeroth, bringing back some classic buffs like Warrior's [Battle Shout](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Battle_Shout) and [Power Word: Fortitude](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Power_Word:_Fortitude), and adding new debuffs such as Monk's [Mystic Touch](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mystic_Touch) and Demon Hunter's [Chaos Brand](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Chaos_Brand).
Not all buffs returned - such as [Mark of the Wild](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Mark_of_the_Wild) which would have to wait until Dragonflight - but we started creeping back to a state where multiple classes were required in raids.

For Shamans, Restoration's [Ancestral Vigor](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Ancestral_Vigor) actually made its return in Legion, bucking the trend at the time.
Elemental Shamans also received [Skyfury Totem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Skyfury_Totem) as a PVP talent in Legion, while melee players' beloved [Windfury Totem](https://wowpedia.fandom.com/wiki/Windfury_Totem) also made a return in Shadowlands along with fairly significant batch of Enhancement changes.
