Greetings fellow Shamans,

TODO: It's no question that one of the most controversial - and often memed about - aspects of Elemental Shaman in retail World of Warcraft is its lack of a raid buff or unique raid utility.
With the recent addition of {{Hunter's Mark}} to the game, Elemental Shaman stands as the lone specialization that lacks a raid buff or unique group utility 
Today I want to discuss Elemental's long history as a raid buff provider

# Vanilla WoW
At its inception Shaman was a Horde-only hybrid class intended to do a mix of damage, healing, and providing buffs to a group.
Shamans provided buffs in the form of totems represented by the 4 major Elements - Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.
They could have 1 totem of each element active, and totem buffs didn't stack if multiple Shamans used the same totem.
These buffs only applied to party members however, so many groups opted to bring multiple shamans per raid in order to buff multiple parties of players.
I've included only the totems that provided what were considered useful buffs, and only at their highest-rank values.

# The Burning Crusade
The Burning Crusade doubled down on Shaman buff utility, retaining all of the original buff totems from Vanilla while adding two new powerful totem options, with [Totem of Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=30706/totem-of-wrath) given to Elemental as a new capstone ability.
In addition, Shamans were given a new keynote ability - [Bloodlust](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=2825/bloodlust) for Horde, and [Heroism](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=32182/heroism) for Alliance.
The original iteration of Bloodlust and Heroism applied only to the Shaman's party and didn't cause the [Sated](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=57724/sated) debuff, so it could be chain cast by multiple shamans on the same group of players.
As a result, most raids stacked 4-5 Shamans whose primary responsibility was maintaining totem buffs and providing lust to the strongest DPS group.
Despite low damage numbers, Elemental was considered an essential part of any raid team to provide its new totem buffs to a group of caster DPS.

In addition, as the only Shaman option for Alliance players, Draenei Shamans provided 
- [Heroic Presence](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=6562/heroic-presence)

# Wrath of the Lich King
Wrath of the Lich King overhauled many specs in the game, bringing new ability, better balance, and overall more streamlined gameplay compared to its predecessors.
Shaman remained the sole provider of Heroism/Bloodlust which - along with all other buffs - now applied to the entire raid at the cost of causing the Sated debuff.
As a result it was considered mandatory to have at least one Shaman in any raid group.
Wrath also brought a plethora of improvements to Elemental and Shaman as a whole, improving our damage to make us more competitive and providing new buffs, including a new Elemental-only raid buff, [Elemental Oath](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=51470/elemental-oath).
