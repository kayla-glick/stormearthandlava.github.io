Greetings fellow Shamans,

TODO: It's no question that one of the most controversial - and often memed about - aspects of Elemental Shaman in retail World of Warcraft is its lack of a raid buff or unique raid utility.
With the recent addition of {{Hunter's Mark}} to the game, Elemental Shaman stands as the lone specialization that lacks a raid buff or unique group utility 
Today I want to discuss Elemental's long history as a raid buff provider

# Vanilla WoW
At its inception Shaman was a Horde-only hybrid class intended to do a mix of damage, healing, and providing buffs to a group.
Shamans provided buffs in the form of totems represented by the 4 major Elements - Earth, Fire, Water, and Air.
They could have 1 totem of each element active, and totem buffs didn't stack if multiple Shamans used the same totem.
These buffs only applied to party members however, so many groups opted to bring multiple shamans per raid in order to buff multiple parties of players.
I've included only the totems that provided what were considered useful buffs, and only at their highest-rank values.

# The Burning Crusade
The Burning Crusade doubled down on Shaman buff utility, retaining all of the original buff totems from Vanilla while adding two new powerful totem options, with [Totem of Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=30706/totem-of-wrath) given to Elemental as a new capstone ability.
In addition, Shamans were given a new keynote ability - [Bloodlust](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=2825/bloodlust) for Horde, and [Heroism](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=32182/heroism) for Alliance.
The original iteration of Bloodlust and Heroism applied only to the Shaman's party and didn't cause the [Sated](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=57724/sated) debuff, so it could be chain cast by multiple shamans on the same group of players.
As a result, most raids stacked 4-5 Shamans whose primary responsibility was maintaining totem buffs and providing lust to the strongest DPS group.
Despite low damage numbers, Elemental was considered an essential part of any raid team to provide its new totem buffs to a group of caster DPS.

As the only Shaman option for Alliance players, Draenei Shamans also provided [Heroic Presence](https://www.wowhead.com/tbc/spell=6562/heroic-presence) to their party.
While this wasn't a Shaman-only ability, most Alliance players already had established characters and didn't want to re-roll, so Shamans frequently filled the role as the provider of this buff in their party.

# Wrath of the Lich King
Wrath of the Lich King overhauled many classes and specs, bringing new abilities, better balance, and overall more streamlined gameplay compared to its predecessors.
Most buffs were changed from party to raid-wide, along with many new buffs added to allow multiple classes and/or specs to bring the same "type" of buff that didn't stack, enabling greater group diversity.
Shaman remained the sole provider of Heroism/Bloodlust which now also applied to the entire raid at the cost of causing the [Sated](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=57724/sated) debuff.
As a result it was still considered mandatory to have at least one Shaman in any raid group.
Wrath also brought a plethora of improvements to Elemental and Shaman as a whole, improving our damage to make us more competitive and providing new buffs, including a new Elemental-only raid buff, [Elemental Oath](https://www.wowhead.com/wotlk/spell=51470/elemental-oath).

# Cataclysm
With the awakening of the Earth-Warder, Deathwing, Blizzard realized that the number of raid buffs had gotten out of control, opting to drastically reduce the number of buffs but allowing most buffs to be brought in some form by two or more different specs and/or classes.
It was at this point that I personally feel Elemental peaked in terms of raid utility.
While we had many buff options in the past, the changes in Cataclysm made us the greatest buff provider with up to a whopping 7 raid buffs that could be active at once including Bloodlust and Heroism.
Totem of Wrath was changed to [Totemic Wrath](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=77746/totemic-wrath), allowing Elemental Shamans to provide another powerful Spell Power buff without sacrificing fire totem damage.
Heroism/Bloodlust-type effects were also given to both Mages ([Time Warp](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=80353/time-warp)) and Hunters ([Primal Rage](https://www.wowhead.com/cata/spell=90355/primal-rage)) for the first time, removing one of Shaman's niche roles in a raid group for the first time.
